<description>The purpose of this mod is to add a significant amount of new animals and plants to the game and increase fauna and flora biome diversity.

12/28/16 A16 update note: Tammabanana updated from the current state of the authors' GitHub, which included a few changes Kaptain made since their last official release:

* New textures for dreamvine, lemongrass, coffee, cobra, junglehen;
* Monkeys are now herd animals, and also got a texture change;
* Coffee was replaced with jitter weed/berries;
* Pandas spawn less frequently.
* but NOT this: Elephants were intended to be a pack animal, but A16 ditched the "carrier" tag and this broke, so I've commented it out for now. 

Tammabanana will fix obvious bugs, particularly ones that are her own dang fault from the A16 update, but will NOT be adding new content or making content changes.</description>
