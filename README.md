#  A16 fork:
Update the current iteration of CK_AnimalPlant_Pack to A16.

I considered updating the last official release, so that I wouldn't be pushing out features Coercion and Kaptain hadn't pushed out themselves yet, but decided against it; I'd have to do extra shenanigans, and it wouldn't help Coercion and Kaptain upon their return like updating their work in its current state would.

Soo, you get a few changes from last official release.

Maintenance-wise: I'll fix any bugs I've created during the A16 update. I'll fix other bugs that are clearly bugs. But I'm not adding new stuff, or changing any of their original content. This is an A16 update only.


# CK_AnimalPlant_Pack
The purpose of this mod is to add a significant amount of new animals and plants to the game and increase fauna and flora biome diversity. New factions have been added to control biome pack animals and introduce new trade resources.
